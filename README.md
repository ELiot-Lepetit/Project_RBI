# Project_RBI
Our project aims to analyze the relationship between state-wise Net State Domestic Product and key socioeconomic indicators, leveraging data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

# Initial Commit by Aashish
Our project aims to explore the patterns and differences in Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) across Indian states. We want to understand how economic growth varies from one state to another and what trends emerge over time.
