# Project_RBI
Our project aims to analyze the relationship between state-wise Net State Domestic Product and key socioeconomic indicators, leveraging data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

## Main questions
Our project aims to explore the patterns and differences in Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) across Indian states. We want to understand how economic growth varies from one state to another and what trends emerge over time.

We’re also looking at how NSDP connects with other important factors like population growth and the contributions of different sectors. This will help us understand how these elements interact to shape the economic performance of each state. Additionally, we hope to uncover, if possible, the reasons why some states perform better economically than others, identifying key differences that could explain these disparities.

Lastly, we’re focusing on identifying the sectors that have the strongest influence on a state’s economic growth and performance. This means analyzing how different industries—such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, or infrastructure—contribute to the overall Net State Domestic Product (NSDP). By understanding which sectors are the main drivers of growth, we can pinpoint where states are excelling and where they might need more attention.
